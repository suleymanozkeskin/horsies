## Latency

| percentile | baseline | candidate | delta | 95% interval | budget | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| p50 | 1.910 ms | 2.058 ms | +0.148 ms | +0.144 to +0.151 ms | 0.500 ms | PASS |
| p99 | 2.672 ms | 2.955 ms | +0.283 ms | +0.149 to +0.404 ms | 1.500 ms | PASS |

## Instrumented plan evidence

One eligible transition per side, executed with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, WAL, TIMING OFF, FORMAT JSON)` and rolled back. These executions are excluded from the latency and server-count measurements.

| | baseline | candidate |
|---|---|---|
| node shape | `ModifyTable(horsies_tasks) > Index Scan(horsies_tasks)` | `Function Scan(horsies_fail_locked_task)` |
| shared hit blocks | 28 | 35 |
| shared read blocks | 0 | 0 |
| shared dirtied blocks | 0 | 0 |
| shared written blocks | 0 | 0 |
| WAL records | 11 | 11 |
| WAL full-page images | 0 | 0 |
| WAL bytes | 1144 | 1157 |

## Server counts

| | baseline | candidate |
|---|---|---|
| client statements | 10000 | 10000 |
| statements inside functions | 20000 | 40000 |
| write transactions | 10000 | 10000 |
| client rows | 10000 | 10000 |
| nested rows | 20000 | 40000 |
| terminal task rows | 10000 | 10000 |
| WAL records per terminal task row | 11.70 | 11.72 |
| WAL bytes per terminal task row | 1188 | 1203 |
| full-page images | 0 | 0 |

## Contract checks

Limits: client statements may not increase; write transactions and terminal task rows must match; WAL-record delta must be at most 0.100 per terminal task row; WAL-byte delta must be at most the greater of 10% or 128 bytes per terminal task row.

- PASS

Full-page writes are disabled in this disposable measurement environment, so checkpoint-dependent image bytes are absent from the WAL-byte comparison.

**Verdict: PASS**
