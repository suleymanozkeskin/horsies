    Identity columns are uuid in the database and strings at the Python
    boundary. The ORM's ``Uuid(as_uuid=False)`` already presents them as
    strings; raw ``text()`` reads would otherwise hand back
    ``uuid.UUID`` objects, and every consumer written against the
    string presentation — kwargs serialization, log slicing, JSON
    payloads — would have to defend against the drift one seam at a
    time. One loader on the driver keeps the presentation single-owner.

    Scope: horsies registers this on the engines IT creates (the
    broker's runtime engine; the integration conftest engine). It is
    never assumed onto engines a consumer application builds — their
    uuid reads keep whatever presentation their driver configuration
    chooses.

    A test double standing in for the engine cannot host driver
    events; registration is a no-op for anything that is not a real
    ``AsyncEngine``.
